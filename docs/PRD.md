### **1. Introduction & Vision**

**FridgeVision AI** is a mobile-first web application designed to solve the daily problem of "what should I cook?" It empowers users to overcome decision fatigue by transforming the contents of their refrigerator into culinary inspiration.

**The Vision:** To create an intelligent kitchen assistant that uses computer vision to identify a user's available ingredients and leverages a powerful generative AI to create unique, delicious, and easy-to-follow recipes on the spot. We are eliminating the need for manual searches and helping users reduce food waste by making the most of what they already have.

### **3. User Goals & Problems**

| User Goal                                                      | Problem Solved                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "I want to cook a meal with the ingredients I have right now." | The app removes the need for recipe browsing by generating ideas based on what's visually identified in the user's fridge.      |
| "I'm tired of making the same few dishes every week."          | The generative nature of the Gemini API provides novel and creative recipe suggestions that the user might not have considered. |
| "I don't know what to do with these leftover vegetables."      | The app helps reduce food waste by incorporating a wide range of ingredients into its suggestions.                              |
| "I need a full recipe, not just an idea."                      | The app provides not only the name of a dish but also the complete, step-by-step instructions on how to prepare it.             |

| Feature ID | Feature Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FE-01**  | **Real-time Ingredient Detection** | The user can open the app and point their device's camera at their fridge or pantry. The app will use an object detection model to identify and list visible ingredients in real-time. A bounding box may appear over detected items.               |
| **FE-02**  | **Ingredient List Confirmation**   | After scanning, the app will display a list of the detected ingredients (e.g., "Tomato," "Egg," "Cheese"). The user can tap to confirm or remove items from this list to ensure accuracy before generating a recipe.                                |
| **FE-03**  | **Manual Ingredient Addition**     | The user can manually add ingredients that the camera may have missed (e.g., spices, oils, pantry staples) to the confirmed list.                                                                                                                   |
| **FE-04**  | **Recipe Generation via Gemini**   | Once the ingredient list is confirmed, the user can press a "Generate Recipe" button. The list of ingredients will be sent as a prompt to the **Gemini API**.                                                                                       |
| **FE-05**  | **Recipe Display**                 | The app will display the recipe generated by Gemini in a clean, easy-to-read format. This must include: <br> • A creative **Dish Name**. <br> • A list of **Ingredients** (based on the user's list). <br> • Step-by-step **Cooking Instructions**. |

### **5. User Flow**

1.  **Open App:** The user opens the web application.
2.  **Grant Permission:** The app prompts for and receives camera access.
3.  **Scan Ingredients:** The camera view opens immediately. The user points their camera at their ingredients. The app overlays labels on detected items.
4.  **Confirm List:** The user stops scanning. The app presents a list of detected ingredients (e.g., `["egg", "tomato", "onion"]`). The user can deselect incorrect items or add new ones manually (e.g., add ` "salt"`).
5.  **Generate Recipe:** The user clicks the "Find me a recipe\!" button.
6.  **View Recipe:** A loading indicator is shown while the Gemini API processes the request. The app then displays the generated dish name and detailed instructions.

- **Recipe History:** Save previously generated recipes for the user to access later.
- **"Magic Wand" Feature:** Allow users to request variations of a recipe (e.g., "make it spicier," "make it quicker").
- **Image Generation:** Use Gemini's multimodal capabilities to generate a unique image of what the final dish could look like.
- **Shopping List Integration:** For a generated recipe, identify missing common ingredients (like oil or spices) and add them to a simple shopping list.
